<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<div class="testimonial">
I’ve known Rhonda for years since her days as a tech at my pet hospital. She has really refined the art of pet/housesitting, and does a terrific job. <b>Competent, calm, caring, very attentive to details</b> (both as regards the 2 cats and dog and ME — after all, owners are perhaps the hardest part of this equation), and a good source of information and suggestions. Takes good care of the house/mail/plants as well, but the animals are the real test, and she passes with flying colors.

Rhonda has been providing Reiki to my 16 year old Siberian Husky who suffers from arthritis in his lower back, hips, knees and neck. She has been treating him for about a month and a half twice a week. His <b>chiropractor is thrilled with his progress</b>. His gait is improving and his knees are no longer buckling after he goes on his short walk. He was restless at night and now sleeps soundly through the night. Rhonda’s reiki services have greatly enhanced his life for which I am deeply grateful.

Rhonda has been taking care of generations of dogs for us (currently the third–a labrador puppy) and as always been <b>conscientious, prompt and utterly reliable</b>. Last time she also helped care for our 7 yr. old child who getting over a cold and not in school. Over the last 15+ years <b>she has become a vital part of our family</b>…I’ve recommended her to many people over the years and will continue to do so…

Rhonda has been caring for my pets in our Glen Park home for 12+ years. The two cats adore her. She has even <b>earned the respect of our crabby, difficult parrot.</b> Rhonda is 100% reliable. She <b>handles little emergencies with common sense</b> and always leaves the place spotless. I never worry about “the children” when I leave town because Rhonda knows just what to do.

We needed a last-minute cat sitter, and not only did Rhonda make time for us in our schedule, but she was super professional during our first meeting, and throughout the entire process. Most importantly, <b>our cats seemed not to even notice we were gone!</b> Highly recommended!

I have never used any pet services before I used Rhonda. She was very kind and alleviated any fears I had about leaving my dog with a stranger. <b>She kept us posted the whole time via text and pics.</b> I will definitely use her services again.

<div class="testimonial">
Rhonda was recommended my by new apartment building and could not have been more amazing. Even though it was last minute, she fit us into her schedule and I instantly knew she was the perfect person to look after my Velcro. Not only does she have great energy, but she’s exactly the person you’d want looking out for your furry family in the case of emergency. Vel <b>took to her so quickly that I knew we were in good hands.</b> I would be hard-pressed to use another sitter after finding Rhonda.

<div class="testimonial">
Rhonda has been taking care of my two cats in my Pacific Heights condo for 5+ years. I trust Rhonda implicitly with my beloved pets and she has an <b>uncanny knack with animals and a passion for what she does</b>. Her professionalism and caring demeanor make it a little easier to travel and be away from my furry friends. I’d highly recommend Rhonda to anyone looking for a responsible, compassionate person to take care of their animals. In addition, Rhonda provides my pets with “pedicures” every 4-6 weeks to keep their nails short (and protect my furniture!)

<div class="testimonial">
Rhonda has been taking care of my pets (one cat and a dog) in Russian Hill for over 4 years and I have would not trust anyone else. She is exceptional with both of them and it makes being away from home a little easier. She is 100% reliable and is always there to help when in pinch.She is so engaged and delightful that I some times think my little ones would rather see her than have me home. She is amazingly caring and extremely professional. <b>I always recommend Rhonda to all my friends</b> looking for help to care after their pets. She is a real find and gem.
